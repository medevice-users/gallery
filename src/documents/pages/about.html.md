## Redesigning diabetes

A Bazaar rather than a Cathedral approach to Diabetes.

## Goals

There are design problems at multiple levels of the diabetes
landscape, which could be addressed by the collective efforts of the
community. The objective of this collaborative project is:

1. To identify the design problems in diabetes;
1. To provide a comprehensive map of these design problems, and link
   them to possible solutions proposed by community members;
1. To provide an
   organizational structure to allow members of the community to serve
   as leads volunteers and connect with other volunteers who want to
   work on a particular problem.

### Participate

Send us your designs via twitter, gist, github patches, or flickr
photostream.
