## The Challenge

> Diabetes Data.  It's **`infinite`**... How can we make sense of it?
> How can it to help you better manage diabetes?
> Are current diabetes data visualization displays working or not working for you? 

## Revisualizing diabetes

This effort came about through a collaboration of members in the diabetes community,
who wish to reimagine data visualization for diabetes.  

##The Prototype
This is a site that provides a central place for showcasing a gallery of
diabetes visualizations, many of which have been created by the community.  
This is an opportunity to learn what works, what doesnâ€™t work, and what the
community needs for visualizations!

## Goals

To crowdsource and learn.  Let's create and evaluate ways of visualizing diabetes
data as a community.  Bottom up, rather than top down, one visualization at a time. 

### Participation

There are three ways to participate.
* Rate the visualizations 
* Comment and share your opinions in the comments/mini surveys
* Send us your own ideas for designs via twitter facebook instagram or flickr (use hashtag #diabetesvis) gist, github patches, or just plain email for posting and feedback

Although some of the visualizations are hard coded working visualizations, we
recognize that not everyone has the ability to program the visualization of
their dreams.  So we would be ecstatic if you even drew it on a piece of paper
with pencil and markers, and took a picture with your cellphone, that would be
very cool too. 

We want your participation! We hope that from the project, we can create better
visualizations of diabetes data, that can meaningfully help individuals, families, clinicians and researchers find insight and inspiration

Thanks!  Jamie Bate, Ollie Glass, Elsa Kaminsky, Joyce Lee, Ben West, and others.
