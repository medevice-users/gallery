## Redesigning diabetes

A Bazaar rather than a Cathedral approach to Diabetes.

## Goals

There are design problems at multiple levels of the diabetes
landscape, which could be addressed by the collective efforts of the
community. The objective of this collaborative project is:

1. To identify the design problems in diabetes;
1. To provide a comprehensive map of these design problems, and link
   them to possible solutions proposed by community members;
1. To provide an
   organizational structure to allow members of the community to serve
   as leads volunteers and connect with other volunteers who want to
   work on a particular problem.

### Participate

Send us your designs via twitter, gist, github patches, or flickr
photostream.

## Vision

> Diabetes Data.  It's **`infinite`**... many questions:

* **What do you do with it?**
* How do you make sense of it?
* How can you use it to help you better manage diabetes?
* current displays: are they working for you? 

This website is a collaboration between members in the diabetes community.  We
wish to reimagine data visualization for diabetes.

This is a site that provides a central place for showcasing a gallery of
diabetes visualizations.  Many have been created by the community, and we
encourage others who have ideas to submit their designs to us to put up in the
gallery.

Each visualization will have its own page, and has a comment section that
allows individuals in the community to have a conversation through social
media.  What works?  What doesnâ€™t work? What do you wish were added or removed? 

Although some of the visualizations are hard coded working visualizations, we
recognize that not everyone has the ability to program the visualization of
their dreams.  So we would be ecstatic if you even drew it on a piece of paper
with pencil and markers, and took a picture with your cellphone, that would be
very cool tool. 

We want your participation! We hope that from the project, we can create better
visualizations of diabetes data, that can meaningfully help individuals and
families manage diabetes. 

This website came about through conversations within the diabetes community,
including Joyce Lee, Ben West, Jamie Bate, Elsa Kaminsky, and others.
